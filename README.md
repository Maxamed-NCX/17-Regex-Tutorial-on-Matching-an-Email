# Regex Tutorial on Matching an Email

Regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string. You can also find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input. This regex matches character information for valid e-mail addresses.

## Summary

This is the regex code that we will be anaylizing today is: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

## Regex Components

### Anchors
- ^ matches at the beginning of the target string
- $ matches at the end of the target string

### Control characters

A backslash, \, followed by one of the characters a, b, f, n, r, t, v represents the ANSI-C interpretation of the control character

### Quantifiers
 - "*"   representing 0 or more occurrences of the atom,
 - "+"   representing 1 or more occurrence of the atom,
 - ?   representing 0 or 1 occurrences of the atom,
 - the bound {n}   representing exactly n occurrences of the atom,
 - the bound {m,n}   representing between m and n occurrences of the atom.

When we used `+` to communicate there is another sequence to be matched as a greedy quantifier. For Example `{n,m}` or `{3,9} as another greedy quantifer to specify the input should be a minimum of 2 characrtors to a maximum of 9 characters.

### OR Operator
The user should be able to enter either "part1" (answer 1), "part2" (answer 2) or "part1, part2" (answer 3). For Exmample ((^|, )(part1|part2|part3))+$

### Character Classes
In this Regex, the charactor class `/d` is used which in Javasctipt classifies the use of any digit from 0 to 9.

### Flags
A regular expression consists of a pattern and optional flags: g, i, m, u, s, y.
Without flags and special symbols (that weâ€™ll study later), the search by a regexp is the same as a substring search.

### Grouping and Capturing
There are 3 groups being captured in this example. The charactor class `/d` in 1st Group is the username of the email account `[A-Za-z0-9_\.-]` ~ "GistGit22". The 2nd group captures the domain name or e-mail service being used `[\da-z\.-]` ~"@.github" Lastly, the 3rd group captures the domain extention (i.e .com or .net) `[a-z\.]{2,6}`

### Bracket Expressions
Similar to groups in this example, there are also 3 bracket expressions. The information in the bracket expressions is opened and closed between brackets like this `[]`. This indentifies which information is allowed to be matched.

Bracket Expression first: `[A-Za-z0-9_\.-]` - includes non-case sensitive characters from a-z, numbers from 0-9 an underscore, periods and hyphens.

Bracket Expression second: `[\da-z\.-]`   - includes all digits, case sensitive characters from a-z, periods and hyphens

Bracket Expression third: `[a-z\.]`      - includes case sensitive characters from a-z and periods.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
Here, we have only used greedy quantifiers `+` and `{}`, meaning that it will allow the match to expand as long as it neess to go. If these quantifiers were non-greedy quantifiers, they would appear as `+?` or `{}?`, this will direct the system to make the shortest match.

### Boundaries
The word boundary \b matches positions where one side is a word character. 

The regex \bcat\b would therefore match cat in a black cat, but it wouldn't match it in category, tomcat or dedication. Removing one of the boundaries, \bcat would match cat in catfish, and cat\b would match cat in tomcat, but not vice-versa. Both, of course, would match cat on its own.

### Back-references
In the example below the group with quotes is named ?<quote>, so the backreference is \k<quote>:
A group can be referenced in the pattern using \N, where N is the group number.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Lookahead The syntax example: X(?=Y), it means "look for X, but match only if after Y". There may be any pattern instead of X and Y.
Lookbehind The syntax example: X(?!Y), it means "search X, but only if not after Y".
